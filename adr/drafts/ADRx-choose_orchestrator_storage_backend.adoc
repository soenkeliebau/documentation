Technical Story: [description | ticket/issue URL] <!-- optional -->

== Context and Problem Statement

The orchestrator will need some form of persistent storage backend, for which a decision on the technology to be used has to be taken.
Our usage of this storage will most probably be extremely simple, even if a SQL database is chosen, the expectation is that it will be used fairly similar to a key value storage.

== Decision Drivers

* Availability of libraries for chosen programming language for the orchestrator
* How established is the backend at potential customers, will we need to deploy it?


== Considered Options

* etcd
* Zookeeper
* SQL Database

== Decision Outcome



=== Positive Consequences

=== Negative Consequences

*
== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== etcd

https://etcd.io/

* Good, because etcd is used by Kubernetes
** Likelyhood that it is already deployed
** Expertise with etcd by Kubernetes admins can be reused
* Good, because it offers watch functionality
* Good, because it offers consensus mechanisms
* Bad, because it has a hard size limit
* Bad, because it does not work well with large numbers of requests

=== Zookeeper

https://zookeeper.apache.org/

* Good, because it is well established and unterstood
* Good, because it offers watch functionality
* Good, because it offers consensus mechanisms
* Bad, because it offers no real benefit over etcd
* Bad, because it is known to have trouble with high volume of changes

=== SQL Database

* Good, because expertise and processes for some form of database will be present at pretty much any customer
** Backup
** HA
* Good, because deploying in integrated test/dev environment is easy with sqlite
* Bad, because we would need to potentially support multiple database vendors
** Postgres
** MS Sql
** Oracle
